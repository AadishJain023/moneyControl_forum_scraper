Operating profit or EBITDA was 46018 crore rupees. It improved compared to last year but did not grow compared to the previous quarter and was lower than market expectations.

It also stopped import of Russian crude. As per initial report emanating indicate that USA would like to export Venezuelan crude to India specially Reliance. Also earlier Reliance Chaiman Ambani had attended Trumps taking over ceremony and also during Trumps middle east visit indicating reasonable mutual understanding of Trump with Indias richest Man. It would be win - win situation for Reliance and India. Im glad that I increased my investment in Reliance during previous week fall. I would also state that India had to stop buying Russian crude purely on commercial considerations. If USA had increased the tariff to 500 percent than dollar supply to India from export surplus would have dried up. Russian was not accepting payment in Indian Rupee.

A Strong Possibility Before March 2026 There is a high probability that Reliance Industries Limited may launch the Reliance Jio IPO before March 2026. Reports suggest that Jio could dilute around 2.5 percent equity, and according to Jefferies, the company is valued at USD 180 billion ₹16.2 lakh cror. At this valuation, the IPO could raise USD 4.5 billion around ₹40,000 crore. potentially becoming India’s largest IPO, surpassing Hyundai Motor India. The upcoming RIL board meeting on 16 December, scheduled alongside quarterly results, could be a key trigger for an official announcement, as Reliance often uses earnings disclosures to outline major strategic moves. With Jio having achieved scale, profitability, and market leadership, the timing for a partial listing appears optimal. When valuation, stake dilution plans, and board-level developments are viewed together, the likelihood of a Reliance Jio IPO before March 2026 looks strong, making it a crucial event for investors and Indian capital markets.",0.0,neutral,0.0,0.0,1.0
