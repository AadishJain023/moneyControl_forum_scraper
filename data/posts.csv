https://mmb.moneycontrol.com/forum-topics/stocks/abbott-india-4882.html,https://mmb.moneycontrol.com/forum-topics/stocks/abbott-india-4882.html,,,,Abbott India,"Abbott India Limited represents a high quality multinational pharmaceutical company with a long standing track record of consistent growth superior profitability and capital efficiency. At a current market price of approximately twenty nine thousand rupees per share the company is positioned at an attractive point in its valuation cycle when assessed purely on fundamental parameters and historical benchmarks. From a valuation perspective Abbott India is currently trading at a trailing price to earnings multiple of approximately thirty nine. This is notably low when viewed against its own historical valuation range. Over the last decade Abbott India has frequently traded at significantly higher multiples and has recorded a historic peak valuation close to sixty five times earnings during periods of strong growth visibility and market confidence. The present valuation of around thirty nine therefore represents the lower end of its long term valuation band and indicates meaningful scope for rerating as earnings continue to compound steadily. When compared with other listed multinational pharmaceutical companies in India such as Sanofi India GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals and Pfizer India Abbott India’s valuation appears even more compelling. Peer multinational pharma companies have historically commanded price to earnings multiples in the range of forty five to sixty depending on growth outlook and product concentration. Despite Abbott India having one of the most diversified chronic therapy portfolios and one of the most predictable earnings profiles it is currently valued below many of these peers, reinforcing the argument that the stock is undervalued on a relative basis. Earnings growth remains steady and visible. Abbott India has delivered revenue growth in the range of eleven to thirteen percent on a compounded basis over recent years while earnings per share growth has consistently remained in the twelve to fifteen percent range. On this basis the price to earnings growth ratio works out to approximately two point six to three which is attractive for a defensive healthcare business with strong brand equity low cyclicality and high earnings reliability. This PEG level leaves room for valuation expansion without requiring aggressive growth assumptions. Profitability metrics further strengthen the fundamental case. Abbott India consistently generates return on equity above twenty five percent and return on capital employed above thirty percent. Operating margins are structurally high and typically remain between twenty five and twenty eight percent while net profit margins are in the range of eighteen to twenty percent. These numbers highlight the strength of the company’s brand led model pricing power and operational discipline. The balance sheet is robust with negligible debt and strong cash generation. Free cash flow conversion remains high and the company has a long record of distributing a substantial portion of profits to shareholders. Dividend payout ratios generally range between forty and fifty percent reflecting confidence in long term earnings sustainability and cash flow visibility. Abbott India’s business is anchored in chronic therapy segments such as gastroenterology thyroid diabetes and women’s health. These segments are characterized by long duration treatments repeat prescriptions and high physician trust. As healthcare penetration insurance coverage and diagnosis rates continue to expand in India these categories provide a stable and growing revenue base supporting predictable earnings compounding. Looking ahead assuming earnings growth of approximately thirteen to fifteen percent annually and a gradual rerating from the current price to earnings multiple of around thirty nine toward its historical average range the stock has clear headroom for appreciation. Even a partial normalization toward valuations seen in earlier cycles combined with steady earnings growth supports a strong upside trajectory. On this basis the current price level of around twenty nine thousand rupees provides a favorable entry point for long term investors. In numerical terms a sustained earnings growth rate of around fourteen percent over the next two to three years results in cumulative earnings growth of over forty percent. When coupled with a reasonable valuation rerating from the lower end of the historical range this earnings expansion supports a share price moving toward and beyond forty five thousand rupees. Under these assumptions crossing forty five thousand rupees per share by the End of 2026 is a realistic and achievable outcome. In conclusion Abbott India is currently trading at a valuation that is significantly below its historical peak and near the lower end of its long term valuation range despite maintaining strong growth profitability and balance sheet strength. This combination of high quality fundamentals steady earnings compounding and clear scope for rerating creates a compelling investment case. From a purely fundamental standpoint Abbott India offers an attractive long term opportunity with a credible path to sustained wealth creation and a realistic expectation of crossing forty five thousand rupees per share by the End of 2026.",0.0,neutral,0.0,0.0,1.0
